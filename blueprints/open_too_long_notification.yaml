blueprint:
  name: Generic Binary Sensor Repeat Notification (Pushover, Adaptive Messaging)
  description: >
    Watch any binary_sensor (plus optional extra triggers): when it turns “on”
    and stays on past the Initial Delay—or any additional trigger fires—send a
    Pushover alert and repeat every Repeat Interval until it turns “off.” Once off,
    send a final notification with the actual open duration. Message wording adapts
    to the sensor’s device_class.
